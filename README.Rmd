Scientists face increasing demand for reproducible workflows and transparent research practices, but have a plethora of computational tools and procedures available to choose from. Developmental Operations or 'DevOps' is a system of project managing code and software development. **We translate 'DevOps' for use in research contexts and present 'ResOps'; a principled framework and guide to computational reproducibility and modern scientific workflows utilising free and open-source software.** Adopting ResOps practices will aid scientific research in becoming more reproducible and transparent.

- A paper on this topic is being developed and can be followed at the [Research Gate Project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/ResearchOps-Translating-DevOps-for-the-Modern-Researcher) page.
